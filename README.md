Dislaimer-**The following is a fictional project including any names**

I was asked to develop a command line Python application for 'Film Flix' to manage their film database.

The project brief is as follows:
* No more than 40 records
* For ease of use SQLite was implemented but due to unforeseen circumstances the developer is unable to connect the database with the python application
* Create, read, update, delete
* filmID(integer), title(text), yearReleased(integer),rating(text),duration(integer),genre(text)
* You have now been tasked with developing a python application to manipulate the FilmFlix database.
Perform CRUD operation on the database from the python command line
1.	Print all records in  tblfilms in database filmflix 2.db
2.	Allows users to add, update or delete records in the filmflix 2.db database (CRUD)
3.	Print a selection of reports, these functions demonstrate different techniques of writing sql commands and printing reports
For example
Hint: for FilmFlix CRUD: create Options menu to include 
Options menu
1. Add a record
2. Delete a record
3. Amend a record
4. Print all records
5. Exit
